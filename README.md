# Configuring Azure AI Search Index

This repository provides instructions for setting up a search index using Azure AI Search service. Follow the steps below to start using Azure AI Search to index data and provide advanced search capabilities in your applications.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure account with an active subscription. Sign up for a free account.
- An Azure AI Search service of any tier and any region. Create a service or find an existing service under your current subscription.
- Check for space. Many customers start with the free service tier. The free tier is limited to three indexes, three data sources, and three indexers. Make sure you have space for extra items before you begin[^1^][1].

## Step by Step

1. **Start the wizard**: Log in to the Azure portal with your Azure account and navigate to your Azure AI Search service. On the Overview page, select Import data to start the wizard[^1^][1].

2. **Connect to a data source**: The wizard creates a data source connection with sample data hosted by Microsoft in Azure Cosmos DB. You don't need your own Azure Cosmos DB account or source files to run this tutorial. Under Connect to your data, expand the Data Source dropdown and select Samples. From the built-in samples list, select hotels-sample. Select Next: Add Cognitive Skills (Optional) to continue[^1^][1].

3. **Skip configuring cognitive skills**: The Import data wizard supports creating a skillset and AI enrichment during indexing. For this tutorial, ignore the AI enrichment configuration options in the Add Cognitive Skills tab. Select Skip to: Customize target index to continue.

4. **Configure the index**: The wizard infers a schema for the built-in sample index hotels-sample. Follow these steps to configure the index: Accept the values generated by the system for Index Name (hotels-sample-index) and Key Field (HotelId).

5. **Monitor indexer progress**: After creating and loading an index, you can monitor the progress of the indexer in the Azure portal.

Hope this helps you get started with configuring Azure AI Search Index!

## Application Example

Imagine a hotel booking website that needs to provide quick and precise search for its users. By using Azure AI Search, you can index hotel details such as name, location, amenities, etc. Users can then perform searches by hotel name, location, or desired amenities and get relevant results instantly. This significantly improves user experience and enhances the efficiency of the hotel booking website's operations.
